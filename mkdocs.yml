# use the Material theme for a polished look
theme:
  name: material
  features:
    - navigation.expand

# navigation block is carefully indented; keep this comment here to
# force a rebuild of the docs when the file changes slightly.

## navigation is automatically generated from the docs/ folder structure.
## no manual nav list is needed here, mkdocs will automatically find
## any new files added to the crates (like widgets/color_picker.md)

# extras or plugins could be added if desired
